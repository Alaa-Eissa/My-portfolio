## 🧕 About Me
I’m a Computer Engineering student at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering in Menouf, with a strong passion for Data Analysis and solving real-world problems using technology.

I started my journey with a curiosity about how data can shape decisions. This led me to explore tools like Excel Power Pivot, SQL, and Python — and build dashboards, models, and data pipelines.

I’m driven by impact: whether I’m analyzing sales trends, building a voting system for a university exhibition, or contributing to social volunteering projects, I always aim to deliver work that’s insightful, organized, and user-friendly
